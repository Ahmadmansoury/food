        <h1>pizza </h1>

        <p>The modern pizza was originally invented in Naples, Italy but the word pizza is Greek in origin, derived from
            the Greek word pÄ“ktos meaning solid or clotted. The ancient Greeks covered their bread with oils, herbs and
            cheese. The first major innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of tomato as a topping. It was
            common for the poor of the area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the
            pizza began.

            While it is difficult to say for sure who invented the pizza, it is however believed that modern pizza was
            first made by baker Raffaele Esposito of Naples. In fact, a popular urban legend holds that the archetypal
            pizza, Pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the
            Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the
            three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pie swathed in the colors of the Italian
            flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named
            after the Queen as Pizza Margherita.

        <p>Neapolitan -pizza (Italian: pizza napoletana) also known as Naples-style pizza, is a style of pizza made with
            tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. It must be made with either San Marzano tomatoes or Pomodorino del Piennolo
            del Vesuvio, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and Mozzarella di Bufala
            Campana, a protected designation of origin cheese made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the
            marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state, or "Fior di Latte di Agerola", a cow milk mozzarella
            made exclusively in the Agerola comune.[1] Neapolitan pizza is a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG)
            product in Europe, and the art of its making is included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural
            heritage.[2] This style of pizza gave rise to the New York-style pizza that was first made by Italian
            immigrants to the United States in the early 20th century </p>
